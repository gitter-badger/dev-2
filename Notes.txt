SPA article notes;

Multiple Views
Page navigation between the Views
Change Tracking
Synching data between Views and ViewModels
Saving and restoring from Local Storage (tombstoning)
Caching data on the client
Filtering, sorting, paging, ordering on the client
Responsive design and UI concepts
Reverse ajax for server to client communications

You can add in your own custom libraries or pull in 3rd party libraries such as Sammy for navigation, Breeze for rich data, SignalR for reverse ajax, or Amplify for local storage. You could use a javascript pattern to keep you organized. You could write the app with TypeScript which is especially helpful if you come from a static language background or if you want to start using ECMAScript 6 features now. If you want ot learn more about TypeScript, keep an eye out on Pluralsight in December for our TypeScript course (I am co-authoring with Dan Wahlin). If you want to see more about these features, you can check out my Single Page Apps blog post series and my Code Camper SPA course with Pluralsight.

TDD Master Class Screen Casts : Roy Osherove [Screencast]
http://tekpub.com/productions/tdd

If you are new to TDD/Unit Tests then I recommend watching the TDD Master Class production from Tekpub.com.
http://tekpub.com/

The production is a series of videos from a week long training seminar presented by Roy Osherove.

In addition to the videos take a look at Roy’s blog post on the string calculator TDD kata.
http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/

If you are interested you can see a video of my efforts of the string calculator kata in JavaScript.
